TODO

    [ ] Alfred: when cleaning up a sub-bullet with an unfinished parent, include the parent in the done file
    [ ] Allow line skipping for indented text


NEW
	[ ] New setting Alfred:AutoAdd:## NEW:MWF:Title
        Adds "[_] Title" under the "## NEW" tag on Monday, wednesday, and Friday

    [ ] Restructure the processing:
        [ ] Get items as trees
        [ ] Pay attention to delimiters for grouping so that text under the delimiter does not have to be decorated
        [ ] The signature of an item should be all of the text that is part of it
        [ ] Store as a JSON document
        [ ] Working on a sub-part always refreshes the parent
    [ ] JIRA integration
        [ ] Must run with -archive parameter to actually archive stuff
        [ ] Is there a good text editing library?

DONE 
	[x] A comment line or blank line should break the parenting

	[x] Implement TIMETOLIVE setting
	[x] Modifying an item should update the date on it's children

	[x] Keep a backup folder with time-based generations
	[x] BUG: Don't Decorate comments
	[x] Add alfred section to files that don't have it.  Include default settings in the section
	[x] Implement COMMENT tags
	[x] Implement START and END tags
	[x] Implement DONE expression
	[x] Implement Include Indented SubItems

	[x] Read in a file from the command line

	[x] What about duplicate lines? (Alfred should decorate them)      
	[x] Store to a memory file [DateFirstSeen]...Contents...
	[x] Read a memory file
	[x] Merge a new file into the memory file
	[x] Store old items into a _Freezer file and fix the todo file
	[x] Think about how to be safe with writing these files so we don't lose data.  Probably write backup, then freezer and done, then alfred, then todo last
